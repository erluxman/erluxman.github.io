I was able to clock 120 days without a break. I almost did them for around 195 days in a span of 200 days. But as this Corna Pendamic hit, I was also afraid like everyone else and going on run where others are also running, sometimes very close to me wasn’t such a great idea. Little did I knew that everyone were like me and stopped going for run, wish I had continued it. After around the start of july, I realized I had lost a really amazing habit that took so long to build. I tried to continue it again but the variables that were right at point when I initially starte weren’t there anymore, specially the friends who were also a part of this early on this journey. So I was in the same rat race of doing it for a week or two and falling back to same old routine. I lost almost 5 more months like this.</p>\n<p>As the new year 2021 was coming close, I really dont not want to make it like 2020. </p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"This is how I am going to be productive and build great habits.","date":"December 18, 2020","spoiler":"The secret behind great habits and amazing productivity.","cta":null},"fields":{"slug":"/00020-100-dasys-of-habits/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/00020-100-dasys-of-habits/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/00019-unbricking-android-with-mac-and-linux/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"00019-unbricking-android-with-mac-and-linux"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Unbricking Android with mac/linux"}},"next":null,"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
