It's been sometime since I have build Flutter Apps. At the mean time, one of my longterm goal was to start writing in regular basis. From today April 05, 2020 I will post 1 Flutter/Dart trick each day for coming 100 days.

I will take this oppertunity to learn and share new stuffs as well as maintaining my discipline and improving my teching skills. 


I will publish GIF/Video each day on twitter and publish one week of content as blog on my site and youtube.

# Let's go
